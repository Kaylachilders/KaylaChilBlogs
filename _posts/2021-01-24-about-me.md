My name is Kayla Childers, I am from Ashburn, Virginia and I am a junior at Christopher Newport University. I am majoring in **marketing** as well as minoring in **digital humanities** (DH).

 I am interested in this course because I recently added [digital humanities](https://georgiasouthern.libguides.com/c.php?g=776356&p=5726309) as my minor and this class fulfills both my minor requirements and writing intensive requirements. I do not know much about the world of digital humanities, but I am very eager to learn about its ins and outs. I have always enjoyed writing, so I hope to further improve my writing skills throughout this course. **Fun fact:** I was a writing tutor in high school.

With my degree, I am interested in marketing management, advertising, and graphic design. I still haven’t been able to decide which type of marketing I want to pursue, but this semester I am taking more core marketing and DH classes. Having said that, I am hoping to have an internship this summer to soon have a better idea of what I want to do after graduation. 

At Christopher Newport, I am a sister of **Phi Mu**, which has been the biggest and most rewarding part of my college experience. Since running home to Phi Mu, I have been given so many opportunities for leadership positions and I am constantly surrounded by girls that support me. My sisters have been great role models for me because they push me to become a better person, as well as keep me accountable for things such as grades. With Phi Mu, I have found lifelong friends and made memories that will last a lifetime.

My little sister in Phi Mu is my best friend and I am so happy to be a role model for her in this chapter
