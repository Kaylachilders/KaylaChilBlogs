### *Summary*
Mapping Cultural Philanthropy is an ongoing DH project by the Dumbarton Oaks Archives that shows the history of philanthropies that helped create the most honored cultural institutions in the Washington, D.C. area. The site presents institutions that were established as early as 1869 to the present day, which include famous museums, concert halls, art schools, and more. The project also highlights the important figures who made these institutions possible by describing their journey as philanthropists and how they each served as “cultural diplomats”. The purpose of this project is to spread awareness about philanthropy and to display the information in an interactive way so that people can have a better appreciation for these institutions.
