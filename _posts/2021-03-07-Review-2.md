### *Summary*
Mapping Cultural Philanthropy is an ongoing DH project by the Dumbarton Oaks Archives that shows the history of philanthropies that helped create the most honored cultural institutions in the Washington, D.C. area. The site presents institutions that were established as early as 1869 to the present day, which include famous museums, concert halls, art schools, and more. The project also highlights the important figures who made these institutions possible by describing their journey as philanthropists and how they each served as “cultural diplomats”. The purpose of this project is to spread awareness about philanthropy and to display the information in an interactive way so that people can have a better appreciation for these institutions.

### *Design*
Mapping Cultural Philanthropy presents itself in the form of a digital map of the Washington, DC area with associated timelines and contextual information. On the map, each institution is represented by an orange dot and allows you to explore that institution further by clicking on the “Learn More” tab. Further, this interactive map was very easy to navigate. I was able to transition to the “Learn More” section smoothly as well as return to the map without any glitches. Along with the ariel view map, the site allows you to drag a “Pegman” onto the map to get a “Street View” of each location. This element was my favorite part of the project because it leads the viewer deeper into each institution and feels as if you are on a virtual tour. This element gave me more insight into institutions that I was unaware of, but I especially enjoyed exploring locations I do visit. For example, it was exciting to view Wolf Trap National Park through this feature because it is a location that my family and I visit quite often during the summers.
