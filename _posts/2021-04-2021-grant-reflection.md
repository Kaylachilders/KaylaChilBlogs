# Grant Process and Reflection

## My Grant 

For my grant assignment, I am creating a digital map, tracking the killing spree of the infamous Ted Bundy, and telling the stories of the women, whom he brutally murdered. The project will be called *The Women of Ted Bundy*. The site will consist of a mapping project as well as an interactive timeline displaying background information about each victim. I chose this topic because I have always been interested in true crime and the backgrounds of both the criminal and the victims. In recent years, the story of Ted Bundy has turned into an entertainment phenomenon, which got me thinking about serial killers in general and what place they have in our popular culture. In our society, notorious serial killers, especially Bundy, have been romanticized in the media. With this being said, the stories of the innocent victims are pushed into the background and often forgotten about. The purpose of my project is to bring the attention back to the victims by centering this site around their stories.

When I first wrote my abstract, I was initially planning to just map Ted Bundy’s murder spree across the US. However, after getting critiques from my professor, I realized I needed to extend my project’s topic in order to make it different from existing ones. During my research, I found a vast number of true crime digital projects that use mapping software to follow the course of serial killers. At this point, I knew I needed to have a different purpose than all the rest. All things considered, I decided to center my project around the victims and their stories. I wanted to implement new ideas and questions about true crime and how the media often ignores the stories of the victims.

After being assigned this grant, I was very nervous and did not know what to expect. I had little understanding about what goes into creating a DH project and what steps are necessary to produce a successful one. For example, I had no idea that a budget was a crucial part to this project, but I learned that nothing can be done without it. Writing the grant one step at a time was definitely helpful because it gave me a chance to really understand the importance of each section. The peer reviews especially helped guide me in the right direction and I feel that my project overall benefited from the advice of my classmates. I knew that my work could be better, so I looked forward to receiving valuable feedback.

## My Experience in Digital Humanities

As the semester is coming to an end, I can say with confidence that I have learned so much from this course. I had just declared digital humanities as my minor when i joined this class, but I had little knowledge about DH as a whole. Now that I've taken this class, I think that DH doesn’t have just one definition because it embodies so much. However, I would say DH is the use of technology to enhance the works of the humanities. This can be through interactive projects, digital maps, blogs, reviews, and so much more. This class has given me the opportunity to complete several projects that lead me to have a better understanding of the field. My favorite assignment was the Yellow Wall-Paper project. I really enjoyed this project because we got to code a section of the story and then blog about our experience. Furthermore, it was exciting to be a part of a project that will eventually be published and gave me a better understanding of what DH is all about. On a final note, I am so happy that I decided to minor in digital humanities. I can already see myself turning into a better writer and digital humanist through this course alone.
