## Oxygen Reflection

## My TEI Experience

For this assignment, I was asked to code a portion of Charlotte Perkins Stetsonâ€™s, *The Yellow Wall-paper*, by using Text Encoding Initiative, or TEI for short. *The Yellow Wall-paper* was written in 1892, which tells the story of a woman, who is undergoing rest cure while suffering from neurasthenia. To properly code the text, I used Oxygen, which is an advanced XML editing software that allowed me to markup and inspect pages 36-39 of the story.

### Markup in Google Docs

Once I was assigned my part of the story, the first step was to markup the text in my own personal Google Doc. There, I annotated the entire document, highlighting things like em-dashes, crossed-out words, page beginnings, weird spacing, added words, and more. I think that my section was fairly easy to markup. I mostly had to comment on easy things like em-dashes and paragraph beginnings. Overall, I was pretty comfortable with this part of the assignment because I use Google Docs on a daily basis for all my courses.

Furthermore, I think that the Google Docs markup was a helpful first step that prepared me for coding in Oxygen later on. I felt more comfortable knowing exactly what I needed to encode before jumping straight into Oxygen for the first time.

### Oxygen and XML

In the beginnning, I was very nervous about this project, mostly because I have never coded anything before, let alone use Oxygen and XML. I would not say I am highly skilled in the field of IT, so opening the software for the first time was extremely overwhelming. Once I opened the manuscript file, I was honestly confused by the setup at first.

Despite my hesitations at first glance, my professor walked us through the software and the tagging process, which definitely helped me understand what I needed to accomplish and also cleared up the purpose of the project. At this point, I was feeling more confident about using the program, especially because we had time in class to work on the project and time for troubleshooting.

While coding *The Yellow Wall-paper* in Oxygen, I actually enjoyed myself because it was not nearly as complicated as I anticipated. However, I did run into a few mistakes. One of my main problems was with page beginnings. I miscoded two sentences that ran on to two separate pages. This is where the **author view** and **validation box** were the most helpful tools in XML. If I had any doubts about my code, these tools helped guide me in the right direction.

Overall, my first experience with TEI was a positive one. There was definitely a learning curve with Oxygen, but I caught on quickly and actually enjoyed it despite some initial struggles. I am happy I had this experience and I think that this project gave me valuable insight on why we should mark up text.
