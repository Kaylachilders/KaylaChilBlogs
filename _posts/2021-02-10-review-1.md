### *Summary*

*Monroe and Florence Work Today* is a rebirth of the documentation of Monroe Nathan Work and his wife Florence Work, who felt obligated to record every known lynching that occurred in the US starting in the 1840s. The purpose of this project is to explain the history of lynching as well as pay tribute to many reformers during the peak of discrimination, including Works himself. For a long time, this inhumane act was considered the norm, fueled by hatred towards people that were different. Workâ€™s recordkeeping shows those who lost their lives to lynching, why, and their social and racial background. Only recently have archives and reports that explain the extent of lynching been open for Americans to rediscover. Plain Talk History created this project to display an important piece of US history and spread awareness about the topic that was ignored for the last 100 years.
