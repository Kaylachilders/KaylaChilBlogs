### *Summary*

*Monroe and Florence Work Today* is a rebirth of the documentation of Monroe Nathan Work and his wife Florence Work, who felt obligated to record every known lynching that occurred in the US starting in the 1840s. The purpose of this project is to explain the history of lynching as well as pay tribute to many reformers during the peak of discrimination, including Work himself. For a long time, this inhumane act was considered the norm, fueled by hatred towards people that were different. Work’s recordkeeping shows those who lost their lives to lynching, why, and their social and racial background. Only recently have these archives and reports that explain the extent of lynching been open for Americans to rediscover. *Plain Talk History* created this project to display an important piece of US history and spread awareness about the topic that was ignored for the last 100 years.

### *Design*

In this project, the interactive tools advance the user’s overall experience. The site allows you to scroll through the project as if you were in a museum, guiding the reader in a specific order. Throughout the project, background information about the topics is displayed, while allowing the reader to click on links that present original writings from that time period, acting as valid sources to the project. The site also includes a link to a short video about lynching. Additionally, the site incorporates interactive maps that add to the historical recordkeeping of Work.

### *Relevance*

This project does a great job using technology to translate the original findings of Monroe and Florence. The creators of this project are well-educated in the history of American lynching as well as Monroe and his lifetime accomplishments. The project presents factual information about the topic, but also has a common assumptions section, responding to, and clearing up the misconceptions about lynching. The creators also include a discussion section, where the reader can visit the [PlainTalkHistory](https://plaintalkhistory.com/) site to learn more. The end of the project also has *Extra Resources*, displaying additional sources for viewers to visit if they are interested in diving deeper into the topics.

### *Findings*

*Monroe and Florence Work Today* does a great job of blending technology and history in an easy to use and visually stimulating way. I enjoyed the interactive aspect of the project, especially the maps that showed the recordkeeping of lynching and other deaths that resulted from white supremacist violence. The map also allows you to control the timeline of when lynchings occurred, however, I found that it was a finicky tool that could be improved for easier use. 

The search bar function zooms in on all the lynchings in a specific area as well as gives background information about each victim when you click their icon. Although the zoom tool is helpful when trying to focus on a smaller part of the country, it does take a little longer to load into a clear picture. There is also an option to show *Special Cases* on the map, which provide a more detailed and significant story about the victim. This function is very educational, but it did take me a few clicks before the description popped up.

Overall, this is a beautifully made site that ran smoothly. The digital aspect of this project enhances the original documentation by Monroe and Florence Work. I feel that the project’s purpose was fulfilled throughout the site by bringing awareness to the history of US lynchings and those who strived to make a difference.
